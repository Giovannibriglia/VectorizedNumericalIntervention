    "\n",
    "We consider the task of computing $P(a \\mid b)$, where $a$ can be a vector of features and $b$ can be a vector of features.\n",

    "In a probabilistic view, this can be computed using:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(a \\mid b) = \\frac{P(a, b)}{P(b)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can exploit the concepts of covariance to compute the conditional distribution of $a$ given $b$. Assuming that both $a$ and $b$ are jointly Gaussian-distributed (just for this example), the conditional distribution $P(a \\mid b)$ is also Gaussian and can be computed using the conditional mean and covariance.\n",
